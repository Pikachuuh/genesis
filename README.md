# genesis
Script to end Session, between Chatwoot and Evolution.

The script was created to cause the chatroot session to close, and which was left open in EVOLUTION, to also close.

Create a directory and leave views.py as a service on your server.

The script was designed for use on both systems running Docker on the same server (chatroot and Evolution).
